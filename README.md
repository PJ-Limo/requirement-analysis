## Requirement Analysis in Software Development
Requirement analysis involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting what is necessary to develop your application. This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.

## Purpose of this repository
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where stakeholders' needs, expectations, and constraints are identified, documented, and analyzed. The goal is to create a clear understanding of what the system must do to satisfy users and business objectives. This phase lays the foundation for the design, development, testing, and deployment stages.
